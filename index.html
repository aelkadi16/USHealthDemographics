          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Age, Income, Poverty Level Rate & Health Risks</h3>
          <p><h5>Analysis 1: Percentage of population In Poverty</h5>   Overall, a general trend can be seen with the increase 
            of poverty percentage within a US state, there is an increase in all health concerns. Additional observation 
            reveals a trend of higher poverty percentages in Southeastern States, along with higher incidences of percentages 
            of all three comparisons provided.</p>

          <p><h5>Analysis 2: Age (Median) </h5> A look into the age comparisons gives insights into particular US States more-so than 
            an overall trend. For example, WV has a higher average age, better healthcare, but unexpected higher percentages 
            of obesity and smokers. Additionally, Northeastern States have a higher average age and better healthcare.</p>

          <p><h5>Analysis 3: Household Income (Median) </h5> There is clearly a relationship between household income and the occurrence 
            of obesity and smoking. The higher the income the less likely one is to smoke and have health risks. Analyzing 
            household income against the lack of healthcare, there is a noticeable increase of risk with lesser incomes. Again, the 
            southeastern states rank poorer than other states for healthcare, and the northeastern states are faring better.  
            Two individual states are on the extremes; TX and MA would be worth looking into as to why TX has such a 
            high percentage of the population lacking healthcare, and why MA is on the extreme of low in healthcare.</p>
